Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) are important components used in the more high tier machines. Making them requires a few steps. First of all, craft an Empty PCB:

[pressureChamber{190, 70, item/empty_pcb}]


















Then there are two ways to make an Unassembled PCB. You can throw the Empty PCB in a Assembly line in which it will be lasered:

[assemblyLine{200, 280, item/unassembled_pcb}]

















Or you can develop a PCB chemically by throwing it in a [link{block/uv_light_box}]UV Light Box[link{}] and then etch it in [link{pneumaticcraft:item/etching_acid_bucket}]Etching Acid[link{}].

After you've created an Unassembled PCB you can finish it by adding some components:

[pressureChamber{190, 520, item/transistor}]
[pressureChamber{190, 700, item/capacitor}]
[crafting{200, 880, key=item/printed_circuit_board}]
