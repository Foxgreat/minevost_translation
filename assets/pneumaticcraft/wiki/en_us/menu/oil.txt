In PneumaticCraft there is only one thing that's being generated, and that's Oil. It is spawned similarly to how Water lakes are spawned. The difference is that Oil lakes are far more likely to spawn deep underground than they are to spawn on the surface. Because of this, assistence from tools like a [link{item/seismic_sensor}]Seismic Sensor[link{}] is highly recommended.

Oil has two purposes: to be refined into high-quality fuels, and to create Plastic. Plastic is used in a lot of recipes in PneumaticCraft.

[prefix{l}]Creating Plastic[prefix{}]
To create plastic, the first step is to refine the Oil in a [link{block/refinery}]Refinery [link{}].

One of the products is LPG. This liquid combined with Coal processed in a [link{block/thermopneumatic_processing_plant}]Thermopneumatic Processing Plant[link{}] will yield Plastic.

Liquid Plastic can then by mixed with dyes in a [link{block/plastic_mixer}]Plastic Mixer[link{}] and solidified into colored plastic sheets.

This may sound quite expensive, but the default recipes for all the above machines are actually fairly cheap.

[prefix{l}]Mod Integration[prefix{}]

PneumaticCraft is of course not the only mod to add Oil; several other mods do too (including BuildCraft and Immersive Petroleum).  Depending on your worldgen settings, PneumaticCraft Oil might not be available, however the PneumaticCraft Refinery is capable of handling the Oil fluid from other mods.
