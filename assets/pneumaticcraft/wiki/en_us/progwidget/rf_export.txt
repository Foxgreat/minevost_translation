[prefix{l}]The 'RF Export' piece [prefix{}]

Note: although this piece is named 'RF Export', it actually uses Forge Energy, which is RF-compatible, but not necessarily limited to just RF.

Drones have an internal buffer of 100,000 FE.  Using this piece, you can export energy from the drone's internal storage to an energy-providing block (e.g. a Thermal Expansion Energy Cell or Immersive Engineering Capacitor).
