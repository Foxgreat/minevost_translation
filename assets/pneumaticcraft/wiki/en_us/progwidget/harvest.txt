Programming Puzzles are used in [link{block/programmer}]programmers [link{}].

[prefix{l}]The 'Harvest' piece [prefix{}]
The Drone will harvest any fully grown crop within the specified area. Items that are dropped from the blocks will not be picked up by the Drone.

[prefix{l}]Using tools[prefix{}]
You can make the drone [link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/inventory_import}] import[link{}] a Hoe. When equipped with a Hoe, the crops will automatically be replanted.

You can force the Drone to only harvest when having a Hoe by checking the 'Requires Hoe' checkbox.

[prefix{l}]Limiting blocks harvested[prefix{}]
The amount of harvest actions can be limited to a specified amount by right clicking the Harvest piece. If set to 1 for example, the Drone will only harvest one block, and end the Harvest program after harvesting that one block.

[prefix{l}]Harvesting specific blocks[prefix{}]
Lastly you can specify which crops are allowed to be harvested by using an item filter. Use the seed of the crop as the item.

This program is done when every fully grown and reachable crop within the area is harvested.
