When placed on Mob Spawners, this item will agitate the Mob Spawner in the following two ways:
1. It will prevent the spawned entity to despawn when the player leaves the area.
2. The spawner will keep spawning while the player is not in the area.

Mob farm anyone?

Sneak-right-clicking the Mob Spawner with a [link{item/logistics_configurator}]Logistics Configurator[link{}] or another Spawner Agitator removes the Spawner Agitator.
