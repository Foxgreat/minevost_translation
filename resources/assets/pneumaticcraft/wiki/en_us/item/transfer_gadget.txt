The Transfer Gadget is a very basic item/fluid transfer item. It can be placed [prefix{l}]between  [prefix{}]two blocks to transfer between them. The best way to place it is to first place down one block, then right click the side of that block with a Transfer Gadget to attach it to that side. Then place the second block next to that block.

The Transfer Gadget will show two colors:
-[prefix{9}]Blue[prefix{}], indicating the input side.
-[prefix{6}]Orange[prefix{}], indicating the output side.
The Transfer Gadget transfers items from the [prefix{9}]blue input side[prefix{}] to the [prefix{6}]orange output side[prefix{}], at a rate of 1 item or 100mB fluid every 2 seconds.

By right clicking the Transfer Gadget with a [link{item/logistics_configurator}]Logistics Configurator[link{}], the input and output sides will toggle.  Sneak-right-clicking removes the Transfer Gadget.
