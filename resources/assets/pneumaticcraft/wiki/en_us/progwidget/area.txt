Programming Puzzles are used in [link{block/programmer}]programmers [link{}].

[prefix{l}]The 'Area' piece [prefix{}]
The Area piece is a piece solely used as parameter for other pieces. To start, you need at least one (but preferably two) GPS-Tools. Select a coordinate with the GPS-Tool. Then, right click the 'Area' piece, and enter the GPS-Tool's coordinate by clicking 'Select GPS 1...'. Select the GPS tool from your inventory. Repeat this for the second coordinate.

With these two points you can create different shaped areas. The following is a visual representation of most of them. The Gold Blocks represent the two selected coordinates with the GPS Tool.

[prefix{l}]Box [prefix{}]
Takes the two coordinates and creates a cuboid from them and either [prefix{l}]fills  [prefix{}] it in...

Creates a [prefix{l}]frame  [prefix{}]...

Or makes it [prefix{l}]hollow [prefix{}].

[prefix{l}]Sphere [prefix{}]
The first coordinate is the center of the sphere. The second coordinate is one of the points laying on the outside of the sphere (thus specifying the radius). A hollow sphere is available.

[prefix{l}]Line [prefix{}]
A line is drawn between the first and second coordinate.

[prefix{l}]Wall (X-axis and Z-axis) [prefix{}]
A stair-shaped wall is drawn between the first and second coordinate.

[prefix{l}]Wall (Y-axis) [prefix{}]
A vertical wall is drawn between the first and second coordinate.

[prefix{l}]Cylinder [prefix{}]
The first coordinate is the middle point of the base of the cylinder. The second point is one of the points on the circle on the other side of the cylinder. Cylinders are available in all axis: X, Y and Z. Hollow cylinders and Tubes (hollow without base) are also available.

[prefix{l}]Pyramid [prefix{}]
The first coordinate is the top of the Pyramid (the pointy bit). The second point is one of the four corners of the pyramid. Pyramids are available in all axis: X, Y and Z. Hollow pyramids are also available.

[prefix{l}]Grid [prefix{}]
The Grid type will add coordinates on a (configurable) interval. This is perfect when filling in an area with torches for example. The interval can be changed with the text box in the Area user interface. The following is an example with the interval set to 3. The grid is being layed out from the first coordinate you specify (meaning that the first coordinate you specify always will be one of the coordinates added. This doesn't necessarily have to be the case for the second coordinate).

[prefix{l}]Random [prefix{}]
From the area specified (specified like the Filled piece), this type will take n random coordinates out of this area, with n being a number that can be inserted in the text box in the Area user interface. This can be used to randomly pick a target chest for example.
